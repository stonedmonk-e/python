# Data Types

# Built-in Data Types
# Text Type:	str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	dict
# Set Types:	set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	bool
# Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# None Type:	NoneType

# we can set the data type, and change it later
x = "Hello"
x = 20
x = 1j # => complex number

# we can set specific data type, which can't be changed
x = complex(1j)
y = str("Hello World")
z = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
a = dict(name="John", age=36)

# we can use type() to check type
print(type(x)) # <class 'complex'>
print(type(y)) # <class 'str'>
print(type(z)) # <class 'list'>
print(type(a)) # <class 'dict'>

# Numbers => numeric data types

# 1. Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, 
# without decimals, of unlimited length.
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522


# 2. Float, or "floating point number" is a number, 
# positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

# float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" 
# to indicate the power of 10
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100


# 3. Complex are written with a 'j' as the imaginary part
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j


# Type conversion => using int(), float(), and complex()
x = 1
y = 2.8
z = 1j

a = float(x)
b = int(y)
c = complex(z)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a)) # <class 'float'>
print(type(b)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(c)) # <class 'complex'>

# Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.


# Random number 
# Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, 
# but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
# Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random
print( random.randrange(1, 10)) # ending number is not considered
